 â€¢ Verify properties (nullability, types, etc.) of vfunc implementations by
   searching for class_init() functions and checking for vfunc assignments. If
   we have access to the source code for the vfunc wrapper function, we could
   transfer its pre- and post-conditions to the vfunc implementation as static
   analysis assumptions.
