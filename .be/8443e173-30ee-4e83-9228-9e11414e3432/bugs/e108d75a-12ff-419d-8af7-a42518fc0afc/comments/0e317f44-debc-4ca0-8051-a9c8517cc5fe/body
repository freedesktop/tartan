Currently, the Clang HTML reports only contain diagnostics from the static analysis plugins, not from other compiler plugins (which operate on the AST rather than the data flow graph). This is a bit confusing for users.

Possible solutions:
 • Ignore the reports.
 • Modify upstream to include all compiler warnings in the reports.
 • Change all the Tartan checkers to be static analysis checkers. This would mean they could never be run at (non-analysis) compile time. Rewriting them would also be tricky.
