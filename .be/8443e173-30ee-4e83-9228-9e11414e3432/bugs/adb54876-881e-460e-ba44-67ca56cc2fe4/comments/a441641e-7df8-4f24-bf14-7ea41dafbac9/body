Add an analyser to the plugin which assumes the initial state of (error == NULL || *error == NULL) for all GErrors.

The intention of this analyser would be to:
 • Prevent unchecked dereferences of GErrors (since they may always be NULL).
 • Prevent overwriting of GErrors (setting one GError on top of another).

This is fairly poorly-defined at the moment, and needs more thought.
