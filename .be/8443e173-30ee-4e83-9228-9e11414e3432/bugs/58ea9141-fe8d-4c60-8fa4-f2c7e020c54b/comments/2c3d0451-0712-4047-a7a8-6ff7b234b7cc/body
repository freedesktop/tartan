Currently the wrapper-compiler-errors script operates as a LOG_COMPILER. Instead, it should operate as a LOG_DRIVER. That would:
 • Allow it to expose the different unit tests in a given C file as individual tests on the command line.
 • Parallelise execution of each unit test (which should hopefully speed up `make check` considerably).
 • Handle logging better.
