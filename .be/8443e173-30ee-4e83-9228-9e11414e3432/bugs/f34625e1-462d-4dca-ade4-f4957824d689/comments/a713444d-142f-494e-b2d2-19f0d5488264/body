Larger projects will commonly have internal GObjects which never get exposed to the world. In order to facilitate analysis using those objects, Tartan requires that they be exposed in a GIR file and typelib.

Tartan needs to grow two things:
 • A way to easily integrate generation of an internal GIR file into a project’s build system.
 • A way of easily loading a project-internal GIR file and typelib to use in analysis.

Note that this necessarily means the first build of the project will not be statically analysable, due to the following dependency chains:
    static analysis ← GIR file ← executable binary ← compilation process
    static analysis ← compilation process
