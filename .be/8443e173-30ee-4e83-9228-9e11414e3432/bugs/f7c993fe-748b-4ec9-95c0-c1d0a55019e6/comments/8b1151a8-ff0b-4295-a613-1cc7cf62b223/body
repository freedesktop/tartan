log-store-pidgin.c:512:11: warning: [tartan]: Unexpected GVariant variadic
argument of type 'char *'. A GVariant format string should be added to the
format argument to use it, but there is no known GVariant representation of
the argumentâ€™s type. The argument must be serialized to a
GVariant-representable type first.

The code being checked is:
    g_variant_lookup (params,
        "account", "&s", &account_param,
        "server", "&s", &server_param);
which is valid.
