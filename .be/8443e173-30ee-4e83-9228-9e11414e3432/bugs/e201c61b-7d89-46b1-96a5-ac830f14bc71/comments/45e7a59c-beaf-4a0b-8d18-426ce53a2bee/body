Check that the type of the closure passed to a function matches the type of the closure used in the callback function.

e.g. Check that in this code:
g_timeout_add (1, (GSourceFunc) my_callback, (X *) user_data);

static gboolean
my_callback (gpointer user_data)
{
	Y *data = user_data;
	/* â€¦ */
}

X is compatible with Y.
